- 👋 Hi, I’m @daniebker
- 👀 I’m interested in fitness, [photography](https://danbakerphoto.com), and web apps. I code mostly in TypeScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code custom google sheets using TypeScript and clasp. Also dabbling in GO.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now.
