- 👋 Hi, I’m @daniebker
- 👀 I’m interested in fitness, [photography](https://danbakerphoto.com), and making games. These days I code mostly in TypeScript, but I have worked in java and C#.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning C++ by building a roguelike using libtcod.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now.
